Feature: Double espressos as a reward

    As a user I want to be able to get double espressos as a reward for helping the barista with exporting a beer in the hipster bag.


    Scenario: Hipster bag and double espresso
        Given that the user is on the homepage "http://localhost:3000"
        When the user helps the barista with exporting a beer
        Then the user should be able to put it in their hipster bag
        And the user should receive double espressos from the barista as a reward
